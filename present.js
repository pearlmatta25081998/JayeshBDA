  I say our friendship is weird 🤯
  We tease each other 🤪
  We argue and disagree all the time 😤
  But still can’t live without each other 😚 
  Guess who am I❓
  Hint - we play role of famous cartoon character 🤭`,
  `Remember when we used to fight for tv remote in front of our grandparents u always used to win it as u were the younger one they used to support u and pamper u more and u always used to tease me about it that u are the favourite child i miss those days alot wish could live them again with u.
  Not only in childhood still we rock every place we go especially the weddings and family functions i love sharing one plate with and commenting and judging people it is always fun with u and always will be as I'm not leaving u alone ever love u more than anything else
  One more thing as you become another year older I don’t want you to worry. It will always be my job to annoy you no matter how old we get.
  Happy Birthday 🥳❤️
